# Hono + React / Vite + Cloudflare + pnpm workspaces monorepo

A monorepo setup using pnpm workspaces with a Hono API and React / vite client deployed to Cloudflare Workers / Static Assets / Turso.

Features:

- Run tasks in parallel across apps / packages with pnpm
- Hono API [proxied with vite](./apps/web/vite.config.ts) during development
- Hono [RPC client](packages/api-client/src/index.ts) built during development for faster inference
- Shared Zod validators with drizzle-zod
- Authentication handled by `better-auth` (email/password, OAuth providers)
- Shared eslint config using `@antfu/eslint-config`
- Shared tsconfig
- Shared UI components in `packages/ui`
- Expo mobile application with NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)

Tech Stack:

- api (`apps/api`)
  - hono
  - hono openapi
  - better-auth
  - stoker
  - drizzle
  - drizzle-zod
  - turso
- web (`apps/web`)
  - react
  - vite
  - react-hook-form
  - tanstack router
  - tanstack query
  - `better-auth` client for web authentication
- mobile (`apps/mobile`)
  - react-native
  - expo
  - expo router
  - nativewind
  - `@better-auth/expo` for native authentication
- dev tooling
  - typescript
  - eslint with `@antfu/eslint-config`
  - turbo
  - syncpack

Tour:

- Base [tsconfig.json](./tsconfig.json) with default settings lives in the root
- Shared packages live in [/packages] directory
  - `api-client`: Hono RPC client for type-safe API communication.
  - `common`: Shared utilities and types.
  - `eslint-config`: Shared ESLint configuration based on `@antfu/eslint-config`.
  - `ui`: Shared React UI components.
- Base [eslint.config.js](./packages/eslint-config/eslint.config.js) with default settings
- Applications live in [/apps] directory
  - `api`: Hono backend application deployed to Cloudflare Workers, using Drizzle ORM with Turso.
    - Features `better-auth` for authentication, configured in `src/lib/better-auth.config.ts`. Auth-related database schema is generated via `pnpm --filter api generate-auth-schema`.
  - `db`: Contains a local Turso development database setup and data.
  - `mobile`: Expo (React Native) mobile application.
    - Uses `@better-auth/expo` for native authentication flows, integrating with the API's `better-auth` setup.
  - `web`: React/Vite frontend application.
    - Integrates with `better-auth` for authentication, complementing the API setup.

> All pnpm commands are run from the root of the repo.

## Using as a Template

If you're using this repository as a template, you can sync updates from the upstream template using git remotes and cherry-pick.

### One-time Setup

First, add the template repository as a remote:

```sh
pnpm template:setup
```

This configures the template remote and fetches the latest commits.

### List Available Updates

View recent commits from the template:

```sh
pnpm template:list
```

Or see commits since a specific SHA:

```sh
pnpm template:list --since <your-last-sync-sha>
```

### Apply Updates

Apply one or more commits from the template:

```sh
pnpm template:apply <commit-sha>
```

Apply multiple commits at once:

```sh
pnpm template:apply <sha1> <sha2> <sha3>
```

Example:

```sh
pnpm template:apply d3d7a0c
```

If conflicts occur, resolve them and continue with `git cherry-pick --continue`, or abort with `git cherry-pick --abort`.

Applied commits will have a `[template]` prefix and include a source link to the original commit in the template repository.

## MCP Configuration (Optional)

This repository supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for enhanced development workflows. Currently configured:

- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation for testing

## Local Setup

### Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm i
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.dev.vars` file in the `apps/api` directory using the example file as a template:

```sh
cp apps/api/.dev.vars.example apps/api/.dev.vars
```

Update the values in the `.dev.vars` file with your configuration:

- **Turso Database**: `TURSO_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` for your database
  - For local development: use `http://127.0.0.1:8080` with `turso dev`
  - For remote: use your Turso database URL and auth token
- **Better Auth**: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (at least 32 characters) for JWT signing
- **Resend** (optional): `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM` for email functionality
- **URLs**: `API_URL` and `WEB_URL` for your local development environment

### Run DB migrations locally

This command applies migrations to your local Turso database if you are using `turso dev` or a local libSQL file.
If you are using a remote Turso dev database, configure `apps/api/drizzle.config.ts` accordingly or use the production migration command.

```sh
pnpm --filter api db:push
```

### Start Apps

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

All requests to `/api` will be proxied to the hono server running on [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787)

## Production Setup

### Run DB migrations on Turso

This command applies migrations to your production Turso database. Ensure `apps/api/drizzle.config.ts` is configured for your production database.

```sh
pnpm --filter api db:push
```

### Deploy

```sh
pnpm run deploy
```

## Tasks

### Lint

```sh
pnpm lint
```

### Test

```sh
pnpm test
```

### Build

```sh
pnpm build
```
